As you can see from the title, this is a Python tutorial  

The purpose of this tutorial is to talk about the power of Python using plain language that is easy to understand.

## Before we start

Before I start discussing Python, I would like to briefly elaborate on my learning experience.

I have to say that learning is a tedious process, and being proficient in a particular language means that you need to practice coding and consult information constantly. Doing something once can be exciting, doing it over and over again every day can be tiresome.

There are always many obstacles in the way of learning programming, unreadable books, such and such obscure jargon, unreadable code, inexplicable errors and incomprehensible ideas.

The tedious process and difficult documentation and tutorials in the initial stages are the biggest reasons why many people give up on learning (at least according to the authors)

It's true that the author himself encountered a lot of hardships while learning to program.

But that's okay, you've found this tutorial.

This tutorial aims to use a simple and easy to understand way to talk about complex content, to simplify the complex is a powerful ability, in the path of learning will always encounter such and such a problem, many potholes have been stepped by the author himself, in the spirit of their own only over the pit to fill the purpose, I have written this tutorial.

In addition, don't pursue perfection too much when learning.

To quote an example given by @liubobo, a vocabulary book in a foreign language, it is impractical to memorize every word in every chapter rigidly and without making mistakes. The correct way to use a vocabulary book is to memorize it from beginning to end, and then come back to it when you can't remember a word at a certain time but you need it again.

Otherwise, you will only stick to the first chapter, you will recite "abandon" day and night, until you abandon the book.

The same goes for learning programming, read the tutorial from start to finish, take careful notes, try to code, but don't be overly demanding of perfection, ask yourself to remember every detail, and when you can't remember something, go back and look it up.

Finally: **This tutorial is based on Python 3.x**.

**Python2.x will come to the end of its statement in 2020, and those advocating Python2 in 2020 should be treated like infidels - burn them!**
